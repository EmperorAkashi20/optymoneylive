                        For quick and efficient collection of taxes, the Income-tax Law has incorporated a system of deduction of tax at the point of generation of income. This system is called as “Tax Deducted at Source”, commonly known as TDS.<br>
                        Under this system tax is deducted at the origin of the income. Tax is deducted by the payer and is remitted to the Government by the payer on behalf of the payee.<br>
                        The provisions of deduction of tax at source are applicable to several payments such as salary, interest, commission, brokerage, professional fees, royalty, contract payments, etc.<br>
                        In respect of payments to which the TDS provisions apply, the payer has to deduct tax at source on the payments made by him and he has to deposit the tax deducted by him to the credit of the Government.

                        PAN stands for Permanent Account Number and TAN stands for Tax Deduction Account Number. TAN is to be obtained by the person responsible to deduct tax, i.e., the deductor. In all the documents relating to TDS and all the correspondence with the Income-tax Department relating to TDS one has to quote his TAN.<br>
                        PAN cannot be used for TAN, hence, the deductor has to obtain TAN, even if he holds PAN.<br>
                        However, in case of TDS on purchase of land and building (as per section 194-IA), the deductor is not required to obtain TAN and can use PAN for remitting the TDS.

                        Income Tax Return filed by the taxpayer is not treated as
                           valid until it is verified by the taxpayer. In the existing
                           process, taxpayer can verify the return using Digitally Signed
                           Certificate (DSC) or by sending signed ITR-V to CPC. As per Rule

                           introduced e-Verification of returns as an alternate for ITR-V.

                        Although an intimation received by an assessee u/s 143(1) within a period of 1 Year from the end of Financial Year in which the Return of Income was filed for the year under assessment can be considered as Assessment by the authorized Assessing Officer, however it is a matter of judgment where 143(1) is taken as a mere Intimation rather than Assessment order.<br>

                        <strong>Assessment under section 143(1)</strong><br>
                        This is intimation from the CPC and is a computer generated statement. All the data available in the Income Tax Return is validated by CPC with reference to the data available in the records of the income tax department.<br>
                        <strong>Scope of assessment under section 143(1)</strong><br>
                        Intimation under section 143(1) is like primary verification of the return of income filed. At this stage of verification detailed examination of the return of income is not carried out. At this stage, the total income or loss is computed after making the adjustments (if any). Some of the adjustments made can be for the following matters:-<br><br>
                        <li>The arithmetical errors in the return of income filed; or</li>
                        <li>Any incorrect claims made in the return of income;</li>
                        <li>Any loss claimed will be disallowed, if return of the previous year for which set-off of loss is claimed was furnished after the due date specified for filing the return of income;</li>
                        <li>Any expenditure mentioned in the audit report will be disallowed if it is not taken into consideration for the computation of total income in the return filed;</li>
                        <li>Any deduction claimed u/s 10AA, 80IA to 80-IE will also be disallowed, if the return is furnished after the due date specified for filing the return of income; or</li>
                        <li>Any additional income appearing in Form 26AS which was not included in computing the total income in the return of income.</li>
                        However, no adjustment shall be made by CPC unless intimation is given to the assessee of such adjustment either in writing or in electronic mode. So, the assessee will get the intimation about the adjustment. If the assessee gives any response, such response shall be considered before making any adjustment, and if no response is received within 30 days from the issue of the intimation, adjustments shall be made by the department.<br>

                        In addition to above, a notice u/s 133C as inserted by the Finance (No.2) Act 2014 w.e.f 01/10/2014 can also be issued by the prescribed Income Tax authority for Return of Income filed for AY 2015-16 and onwards within a time period of 4 years or 6 years as prescribed u/s 153. <br>
                        Every taxpayer has to furnish the details of his income to the Income-tax Department. These details are to be furnished by filing up his return of income. Once the return of income is filed up by the taxpayer, the next step is the processing of the return of income by the Income Tax Department. The Income Tax Department examines the return of income for its correctness. The process of examining the return of income by the Income Tax department is called as “Assessment”. Assessment also includes re-assessment and best judgment assessment under section 144. <br>
                        Under the Income-tax Law, there are four major assessments given below: <br>
                        <li>Assessment under section 143(1), i.e., Summary assessment without calling the assessee.</li>
                        <li>Assessment under section 143(3), i.e., Scrutiny assessment.</li>
                        <li>Assessment under section 144, i.e., Best judgment assessment.</li>
                        <li>Assessment under section 147, i.e., Income escaping assessment.</li>
                        All the above mentioned notices are issued which leads to the given assessment proceedings. <br>

                                    of generation of income. This system is called as &ldquo;Tax
                                    Deducted at Source&rdquo;, commonly known as TDS.</li>
                                 <li>Under this system tax is deducted at the origin of the
                                    income. Tax is deducted by the payer and is remitted to the
                                    Government by the payer on behalf of the payee.</li>
                                 <li>The provisions of deduction of tax at source are applicable
                                    to several payments such as salary, interest, commission,
                                    brokerage, professional fees, royalty, contract payments, etc.</li>

                                    him and he has to deposit the tax deducted by him to the credit
                                    of the Government.</li>

                     <p><strong>Assessment under section 143(1)</strong></p>
                     <p>This is intimation from the CPC and is a computer generated statement. All the data available in the Income Tax Return is validated by CPC with reference to the data available in the records of the income tax department.</p>
                     <p><strong>Scope of assessment under section 143(1)</strong></p>
                     <p>Intimation under section 143(1) is like primary verification of the return of income filed. At this stage of verification detailed examination of the return of income is not carried out. At this stage, the total income or loss is computed after making the adjustments (if any). Some of the adjustments made can be for the following matters:-</p>
                     <ul>
                     <li>The arithmetical errors in the return of income filed; or</li>
                     <li>Any incorrect claims made in the return of income;</li>
                     <li>Any loss claimed will be disallowed, if return of the previous year for which set-off of loss is claimed was furnished after the due date specified for filing the return of income;</li>
                     <li>Any expenditure mentioned in the audit report will be disallowed if it is not taken into consideration for the computation of total income in the return filed;</li>
                     <li>Any deduction claimed u/s 10AA, 80IA to 80-IE will also be disallowed, if the return is furnished after the due date specified for filing the return of income; or</li>
                     <li>Any additional income appearing in Form 26AS which was not included in computing the total income in the return of income.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>However, no adjustment shall be made by CPC unless intimation is given to the assessee of such adjustment either in writing or in electronic mode. So, the assessee will get the intimation about the adjustment. If the assessee gives any response, such response shall be considered before making any adjustment, and if no response is received within 30 days from the issue of the intimation, adjustments shall be made by the department.</p>

                                 <p>After successful filing of Return of Income by an assessee u/s 139, the major notices that can be expected to come within a period of 1 year from the end of Financial Year in which the said return was filed is Intimation Notice U/s 143(1), Notice for Scrutiny Assessment u/s 143(2) ( within a period of 6 months from the end of the Financial Year in which the said return was filed) and Notice for Best Judgement Assessment u/s 142(1).</p>

                     <p>Every taxpayer has to furnish the details of his income to the Income-tax Department. These details are to be furnished by filing up his return of income. Once the return of income is filed up by the taxpayer, the next step is the processing of the return of income by the Income Tax Department. The Income Tax Department examines the return of income for its correctness. The process of examining the return of income by the Income Tax department is called as &ldquo;Assessment&rdquo;. Assessment also includes re-assessment and best judgment assessment under section 144.</p>
                     <p>Under the Income-tax Law, there are four major assessments given below:</p>
                     <ul>

                     <li>Assessment under section 143(3), i.e., Scrutiny assessment.</li>
                     <li>Assessment under section 144, i.e., Best judgment assessment.</li>
