                              <p>As per the provisions of Section 139, every assessee whose gross total income does not exceeds the basic exemption limit for any financial year, he will be relieved from filing the return for the said assessment year.</p>
                              <p>However, as per the amended provisions of section 139(1), where the gross total income of the assessee after including the exempted income u/s 10(38) i.e. Long term capital gain on sale of listed securities, exceeds the basic exemption limit, he shall be compulsorily required to file the Income Tax Return for the said financial year even if his net taxable income is less than the basic exemption limit.</p>
                              <p>This means that even if your taxable income is less than the basic exemption limit of Rs. 2,50,000 but because of exempt LTCG income, the total amount exceeds Rs 2,50,000, then filing of return of income is mandatory. The above provisions are applicable with effect from 1.04.2017.</p>

                        <div class="collapse" id="accordion-tab-1-content-3" aria-labelledby="accordion-tab-1-heading-3" data-parent="#accordion-tab-1">
                           <div class="card-body">
                              The probable ways of withdrawal of funds / distribution of funds of a private limited company under different case and its Tax implication is discussed as hereunder:
                              <strong><em>Case 1: In case of voluntary winding up of company</em></strong>
                              In case a company has voluntarily passed the resolution for winding up / liquidation and the company has no other debts/ loan / creditors outstanding at the time of liquidation, in such case the company can distribute the funds available with the company to the shareholders which could be in the nature of <strong>Income or Capital.</strong>
                              &nbsp;
                              <ul>
                                 <li><strong><u>Income-</u></strong>if a distribution to members is from income generated by the company through trading activities or operation activities, then it will be <strong>deemed to be a dividend paid</strong> to members out of profits derived from the company i.e. distribution to the extent of accumulated Reserve &amp; Surplus (Retained Earnings) of the company would be termed as Deemed Dividend u/s 2(22)(d) in the hands of the Shareholders. On this dividend the company would be required to pay <strong>Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) </strong>of 15% + surcharge + Cess (16.995% effective Rate).</li>
                                 <li><strong><u>Capital -</u></strong> Because the liquidation of a company gives rise to the cancellation of the shares in the company, a capital gain or loss could arise. In simple terms, a capital gain would arise for the shareholders if the capital proceeds from the cancellation of the shares exceed the cost base of the shares. The time the capital gain arises is when the shares are cancelled (i.e. at the time the company is dissolved). As such Capital Gain Tax (CGT) has to be calculated <strong>for the members</strong> in accordance to <strong>section 46(2) of Income Tax Act</strong>.
                                    <strong><em>Case 2: In case of buy back of shares of company</em></strong> An obvious question that comes to one’s mind is whether buyback, as a means of surplus cash distribution, is more tax efficient over dividend pay-outs. The answer is not straightforward since it depends on several variable factors such as nature of shares (listed/unlisted), residential status of the investor, period of holding, etc.
                                 </li>
                                 <li><strong>Buyback of shares listed on recognised stock exchange in India</strong>
                                    There are generally no tax implications in the hands of company on buyback of its shares under the modes prescribed under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy back of Securities) Regulations, 1998, since Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) and buyback tax (BBT) are not triggered.
                                    The buyback of shares listed on a stock exchange can be considered as a tax-efficient mode of surplus cash distribution from the company’s standpoint.
                                    <strong>In the hands of the shareholders</strong> (irrespective of residential status), a buyback triggers capital gain tax since exemption under Section 10(34A) is available only in cases where BBT is paid by the company. The buyback of listed shares held for over a year, qualifies as long term capital gain (LTCG) and the same is tax exempt under Section 10(38) of the Act if shares are bought back before March 31, 2018.
                                    Else, the same may trigger capital gain tax implications in the hands of shareholders. However, MAT implications would get trigged in the hands of resident corporate shareholders.<br>
                                    In case the shares are held for a period less than a year, the gains would qualify as short term capital gain (STCG) and would generally be taxable at an effective tax rate of 16.22% (inclusive of surcharge &amp; cess). <br>
                                    It will be worthwhile to note that a non-resident investor possessing a valid Tax Residency Certificate can avail the beneficial provisions of the relevant Double Tax Avoidance Agreement entered into by the Indian government with its tax residence country.<br>
                                    In case the shares are held as stock-in trade, then any gain arising out of buyback would be taxable as business income as per commercial principles.
                                    <br>However, if gains are arising to non-resident shareholders pursuant to buyback, the company is required to withhold tax at the applicable rates. Absence of adequate details of non-resident investors in case of buybacks executed over a stock exchange, could impose certain practical challenges for the company for discharging its withholding tax obligations.
                                 </li>
                                 <li><strong>Buyback of unlisted shares</strong>
                                    A domestic company is required to pay BBT at the rate of 23.072% (inclusive of surcharge and cess) on buyback of its unlisted shares implemented under any mode prescribed under the Companies Act, 1956. BBT is an additional tax in the hands of the domestic company over and above its income tax liability. <br>
                                    In terms of Section 10(34A), a shareholder participating in such a buyback scheme enjoys tax exemption, irrespective of whether shares are held as capital assets or stock-in-trade and irrespective of availability of treaty benefit. Further, no MAT liability is triggered in the hands of a corporate shareholder.<br>
                                    These provisions, compared with the provisions of taxability of dividend distribution, make the buyback of shares a tax efficient manner of distribution of surplus cash, especially in case of large shareholders subject to tax on dividend receipt (Individuals, HUFs, certain trusts, etc).

                              <p>PAN stands for Permanent Account Number and TAN stands for Tax Deduction Account Number. TAN is to be obtained by the person responsible to deduct tax, i.e., the deductor. In all the documents relating to TDS and all the correspondence with the Income-tax Department relating to TDS one has to quote his TAN.</p>
                              <p>PAN cannot be used for TAN, hence, the deductor has to obtain TAN, even if he holds PAN.
                                 However, in case of TDS on purchase of land and building (as per section 194-IA) as discussed in previous FAQ, the deductor is not required to obtain TAN and can use PAN for remitting the TDS.

                              TDS is the act of collecting taxes on<strong>payments for services</strong>by a resident to any person where such payments bears a <strong>character of Income</strong> in the hands of recipient. GST is an indirect tax that is levied on the supply of goods &amp; services. According to the Indian Tax Laws, the receiver of service is required to do two things at the time of making any payment:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Pay GST on the services received.</li>
                                 <li>Calculate TDS on Income and deduct it from the payment made.
                                    GST being an Indirect tax doesn’t bear the character of income and hence is<strong><u>not liable to be part of TDS deduction</u></strong>. GST which is collected has to be deposited to the government. So logically, TDS is not required to be deducted from the amount that is inclusive of Income Tax and should be deducted from the amount that is exclusive of the GST. But if GST amount has not been disclosed separately in the invoice, then TDS in such case would be deducted from the total amount i.e the amount that is inclusive of GST.

Deduction in respect of interest on housing loan in case of a self-occupied property cannot exceed Rs. 2,00,000 or Rs. 30,000, as the case may be (discussed later).

                              <p>While computing income chargeable to tax under the head "Income from house property" in case of a let-out property, the taxpayer can claim deduction under section 24(b) on account of interest on loan taken for the purpose of purchase, construction, repair, renewal or reconstruction of the property. Deduction on account of interest is classified in two forms, viz., interest pertaining to pre-construction period and interest pertaining to post-construction period. Post-construction period interest is the interest pertaining to the relevant year (i.e., the year for which income is being computed). Pre-construction period is the period commencing from the date of borrowing of loan and ends on earlier of the following:</p>

                              <p>The provisions relating to deduction under section 24(b) on account of interest on housing loan in case of self-occupied property are same as applicable in case of let-out property. In other words, deduction available to taxpayer under section 24(b) in respect of self-occupied property will be 1/5th of interest pertaining to pre-construction period (if any) + Interest pertaining to post-construction period (if any). However, in the case of self-occupied property, deduction under section 24(b) cannot exceed Rs.2,00,000 or Rs. 30,000 (as the case may be). If all the following conditions are satisfied, then the limit in respect of interest on borrowed capital will be Rs.2,00,000:</p>

                                 <li>Capital is borrowed for the purpose of acquisition or construction (i.e., not for repair, renewal, reconstruction).</li>
                                 <li> Acquisition or construction is completed within 5 years from the end of the financial year in which the capital was borrowed.</li>
                                 <li>The person extending the loan certifies that such interest is payable in respect of the amount advanced for acquisition or construction of the house or as re-finance of the principal amount outstanding under an earlier loan taken for acquisition or construction of the property.

                              <p>Deduction u/s 80CCD for deposit under NEW PENSION SCHEME has been introduced for all tax payers whether employed by the Government, any other employers or Self employed individuals in addition to Section 80C with a combined limit to&nbsp;<strong><u>Rs.2 Lakhs</u></strong>.<br>
                                 <em><u>NPS Tax Benefits under Sec.80CCD (1)</u></em><br>
                                 The maximum benefit available is Rs.1.5 lakh (including Sec.80C limit).<br>
                                 An individual&rsquo;s maximum 10% of annual income or an employee&rsquo;s (10% of Basic + DA) contribution will be eligible for deduction.<br>
                                 As I said above, this section will form the part of Sec.80C limit.<br>
                                 <em><u>NPS Tax Benefits under Sec.80CCD (1B)</u></em><br>
                                 This is the additional tax benefit of up to Rs.50,000 eligible for income tax deduction and was introduced in the Budget 2015 for voluntary contribution to NPS.<br>
                                 Introduced in Budget 2015. One can avail the&nbsp;benefit of this Sect.80CCD (1B) from FY 2015-16.<br>
                                 Both self-employed and employees are eligible for availing this deduction.<br>
                                 This is over and above Sec.80CCD (1) i.e. If the taxpayer contributes more than Rs.1.5 lakh to the NPS in a year, the amount in excess of Rs 1.5 lakh can be treated as voluntary investment and claimed as a deduction under the new Section 80CCD(1b).<br>
                                 <em><u>NPS Tax Benefits under Sec.80CCD (2)</u></em><br>
                                 There is a misconception among many that there is no upper limit for this section. However, the limit is&nbsp;<strong>least</strong>&nbsp;of 3 conditions.<br>
                                 1) Amount contributed by an employer,<br>
                                 2) 10% of Basic Salary (Basic + DA) and<br>
                                 3) Gross Total Income.<br>
                                 This is&nbsp;<strong>additional deduction</strong>&nbsp;which will not form the part of Sec.80C limit.<br>
                                 The deduction under this section will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be eligible for&nbsp;<strong>self-employed</strong>.<br>

                                 The scheme was introduced by the government as&nbsp;<strong>RGESS</strong>&nbsp;(Rajiv Gandhi Equity Saving Scheme) under which an individual investing would be eligible to claim&nbsp;<strong>50% of the invested amount</strong>&nbsp;as deduction from his total income to a maximum limit of INR 50,000.<br>

                                 However, if the employer doesn&rsquo;t provide HRA to any employee who is paying rent towards any furnished / unfurnished accommodation, such employee can resort to&nbsp;<strong>Section 80GG</strong>&nbsp;for deduction from Gross Taxable Income.

                              <p>The two terms often used interchangeably is &ldquo;Medical Reimbursement&rdquo; and &ldquo;Medical Allowance&rdquo; of which&nbsp;<u>Medical Re-imbursement by employer is&nbsp;<strong>Not Taxable</strong></u>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<u>Medical Allowance is&nbsp;<strong>taxable</strong></u>&nbsp;at the Marginal Income Tax Rate (Income Rate Slab) of the employee.<br>
                                 Both the employer and the employee try to structure salary to maximize in-hand income of the employee.&nbsp;There are certain allowances or expense reimbursements that are&nbsp;<strong>not taxable</strong>&nbsp;in the hands of the employee. One such payment from employer is&nbsp;<strong>reimbursement of the medical expenses</strong>&nbsp;of the employee or his family.<br>
                                 On the other hand, Medical allowance is a fixed part of an employees&rsquo; salary which is taxable in the hands of the employee under the head &ldquo;Salary&rdquo;.<br>
                                 <strong>The reimbursement is only on actual basis</strong>&nbsp;(employer can&rsquo;t reimburse more than you have incurred). Contrast this with fixed medical allowance, which is guaranteed regardless of whether the employee (or his family member) undergo medical treatment or not.<br>
                                 Reimbursement of medical expenses by the employer is exempt to the extent of&nbsp;<strong>Rs.15000</strong>&nbsp;per financial year. Any additional reimbursement would be taxable as Salary in the hands of the employee.<br>
                                 <strong>In addition to above, there are specific scenarios where the entire amount reimbursed/cost incurred by the employer is exempt from tax i.e. there is no cap on tax exemption.</strong><br>

                              <p> On February 1, 2018, the Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley, presented the Union Budget for the year 2018.&nbsp;List of all the proposals related to deductions under chapter VI-A is highlighted as under:
                              <ol start="1">
                                 <li><u>Hike in deduction limit for health insurance premium and/ or medical expenditure from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000 under&nbsp;<strong>section 80D</strong>.</u><br>
                              </ol>
                              The current deduction u/s 80D of&nbsp;<strong>INR 30,000</strong>&nbsp;allowed to an Individual or HUF with respect to premium amount paid for health insurance (medical policy) for dependent parent / parents being Senior Citizen (age above 60 Yrs) has been enhanced vide Finance Bill 2018 to&nbsp;<strong>INR 50,000</strong>. The above increment of deduction is also applicable to an individual for premium amount of his medical policy if he has attained the age of 60 and above.
                              <ol start="2">
                                 <li><u>Deduction limit under section 80DDB is enhanced</u><br>
                              </ol>
                              The deduction limit for medical expenditure for certain critical illness has been increased from Rs. 60,000 (in case of senior citizens) and from Rs. 80,000 (in case of very senior citizens) to&nbsp;<strong>Rs. 1 lakh</strong>&nbsp;for all senior citizens, under section 80DDB.
                              The differentiation between senior and super senior citizen is removed
                              <ol start="3">
                                 <li><u>Deductions under Section 80JJAA is extended to footwear and leather industry</u><br>
                              </ol>
                              Section 80JJAA allows deductions to the manufacturers who employ new employees for a minimum period of&nbsp;<strong>240 days</strong>&nbsp;during the year. This deduction is calculated at the rate of 30% of the additional employee cost incurred by the assessee during the year.
                              The eligibility of a manufacturer to claim this deduction is determined only if he gives employment for a minimum period of 240 days during the year. However, for apparel industry the minimum period of employment is relaxed to 150 days.&nbsp;<strong>The concession of minimum employment period for 150 days has been extended to footwear and leather industry.</strong>
                              Manufacturers are often denied the deduction if an employee is employed in year 1 for a period of less than 240 days or 150 days, but continues to remain employed for more than 240 days or 150 days in year 2. To overcome some difficulties, the employment conditions has been proposed to be relaxed. Now in this situation the deduction shall be allowed to the manufacturer if an employee hired in last year continues to remain in employment in current year for more than 240 or 150 days, as the case may be.

                                 <li>To promote agricultural activities a&nbsp;<strong>new section 80PA</strong>&nbsp;is proposed to be inserted. This new provision proposes 100% deductions of profits for a period of 5 years to farm producer companies.<br>
                                 <li>This deduction is allowed to farm producer companies who have&nbsp;<strong>total turnover of less than Rs. 100 crores</strong>&nbsp;during the financial year. For claiming this deduction, companies' gross total income should include income from:<br>

                                 <li><u>Exemption of interest income on deposits with banks and post offices to be increased from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 50,000 only for senior citizens.</u><br>
                              </ol>
                              The current deduction u/s 80 TTA for Individuals / HUF with respect to interest on savings bank account of Rs.10,000 has been enhanced for Senior Citizens by inserting a new&nbsp;<strong>section 80 TTB&nbsp;</strong>to Rs.50,000.
                              That is to say, this provision allows deduction of up to Rs. 50,000 to the senior citizen who has earned interest income from deposits&nbsp;<strong>(both Fixed &amp; Savings)</strong>&nbsp;with banks or post office or co-operative banks.
                              After introducing this new deduction, the existing deduction of up to Rs. 10,000 under Section 80TTA shall not be allowed to the senior citizens.
                              <ol start="6">

                              </ol>
                              As per existing provisions of&nbsp;<strong>Section 80AC</strong>&nbsp;of the Act, no deduction would be admissible under section 80-IA or section 80-IAB or section 80-IB or section 80-IC or section 80-ID or section 80-IE, unless the return of income by the assessee is furnished on or before the due date specified under Section 139(1).
                              This burden of filing of return on time is not casted on other assesses who are claiming deductions under other similar provisions.
                              Therefore, to bring uniformity in all income-based deduction, it is now proposed that the scope of section 80AC shall be extended to all similar deductions which are covered in&nbsp;<strong>heading "C.&mdash;Deductions in respect of certain incomes" in Chapter VIA (sections 80 H to 80RRB</strong>). The impact of such amendment shall be that no deduction would be allowed to a taxpayer under&nbsp;<strong>Heading C</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<u>Deductions Chapter</u>&nbsp;if income-tax return is not filled on or before the due date.
                              This amendment will take effect, from 1<sup>st&nbsp;</sup>April, 2018 and will accordingly apply in relation to the assessment year 2018-19 and subsequent assessment years.

                              These deductions are allowed subject to certain conditions as given below:
                              <li>It is incorporated between 01/04/2016 and 31/03/2019<br>

                              In order to improve the effectiveness of the scheme for promoting start-ups in India, it is proposed to make following changes in the taxation regime for the start -ups:

                              From the above example it is clear that Mr. X should opt for option 2, because since in this situation the tax liability (excluding cess as applicable) comes to Rs. 47,190 which is less than tax liability under option 1 i.e. Rs. 77,500. Tax liability after EC @ 2% and SHEC @ 1% will come to Rs. 48,606.</p>

                              <p>Basic exemption limit means the level of income up to which a person is not required to pay any tax. This Basic exemption limit is available only for Individual, HUF, AOP, BOI and artificial judicial persons<br>
                                 We all know that if the income is below the basic exemption limit, then there will be no tax liability. But always a question arises that &lsquo;can an individual adjust the basic exemption limit against long-term capital gain?&rsquo;<br>
                                 The answer will depend on the residential status of the individual that is whether the individual or HUF is resident or Non-resident.<br>
                                 Only a resident individual/HUF can adjust the exemption limit against LTCG. Thus, a non-resident individual and non-resident HUF cannot adjust the basic exemption limit against LTCG.<br>
                                 A resident individual can adjust the LTCG with Basic exemption limit, but only after making adjustment of other income. That means, first income under other heads (other than LTCG) is to be adjusted against the basic exemption limit and then the remaining limit (if any) can be adjusted against LTCG.

                              <p>Section 54 provides exemption from payment of Tax on Long term capital gain earned by virtue of sale of a Long term immovable property, being a House property to the extent of&nbsp;<strong>Lower of the following</strong>:
                              <li>Amount of&nbsp;<strong>capital gains</strong>&nbsp;arising on transfer of residential house; or<br>
                              <li>Amount&nbsp;<strong>invested in purchase/construction</strong>&nbsp;of new residential house property [including the amount deposited in Capital Gains Deposit Account Scheme]&nbsp;<br>
                              </ol>
                              An&nbsp;<strong>individual or HUF</strong>&nbsp;only can claim benefit u/s 54 upon fulfillment of following basic conditions:
                              <li>The asset transferred should be a long-term capital asset, being a residential house property.<br>
                              <li>Within a period of one year before or two years after the date of transfer of old house, the taxpayer should acquire another residential house or should construct a residential house within a period of three years from the date of transfer of the old house. In case of compulsory acquisition the period of acquisition or construction will be determined from the date of receipt of compensation (whether original or additional).<br>
                              </ol>
                              However, with effect from&nbsp;<strong>assessment year 2015-16&nbsp;</strong>exemption can be claimed only in respect of&nbsp;<strong>one residential house property purchased/constructed in India</strong>. If more than one house is purchased or constructed, then exemption under section 54 will be available in respect of one house only. No exemption can be claimed in respect of house purchased outside India.
                              Text of Amendments in for the above Sections is given as under:
                              <em>&ldquo;In section 54 of the Income-tax Act, in sub-section (1), for the words &ldquo;constructed,&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;</strong>residential house&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;constructed,&nbsp;<strong>one&nbsp;</strong>residential house in India&rdquo; shall be substituted with effect from the 1st day of April, 2015.&rdquo;</em>
                              Besides, to keep a check on the misutilization of this exemption, a restriction is imposed upon the assessee availing this exemption. The provisions of Section 54 reads as:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>The restriction will be attracted, if after claiming exemption under section 54, the new house is sold before a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase/completion of construction.<br>
                                 <li>If the new house is sold before a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase/completion of construction, then at the time of computation of capital gain arising on transfer of the new house, the amount of capital gain claimed as exempt under section 54 will be deducted from the cost of acquisition of the new house.<br>

                              <p>Capital gain arises if a person transfers a capital asset. section 47 excludes various transactions from the definition of 'transfer'. Thus, transactions covered under section 47 are not deemed as 'transfer' and, hence, these transactions will not give rise to any capital gain.  Transfer of capital asset by way of gift, will, etc., are few major transactions covered in section 47. Thus, if a person gifts his capital asset to any other person, then no capital gain will arise in the hands of the person making the gift (*).<br><br>
                                 If the person receiving the capital asset by way of gift, will, etc. subsequently transfers such asset, capital gain will arise in his hands. Special provisions are designed to compute capital gains in the hands of the person receiving the asset by way of gift, will, etc. In such a case, the cost of acquisition of the capital asset will be the cost of acquisition to the previous owner and the period of holding of the capital asset will be computed from the date of acquisition of the capital asset by the previous owner.<br><br>
                                 (*) As regards the taxability of gift in the hands of person receiving the gift, separate provisions are designed under section 56.

                                 <p>Stamp duty value means the value adopted or assessed or assessable by any authority of a State Government for the purpose of payment of stamp duty.<br>
                                    As per section 50C, while computing capital gain arising on transfer of land or building or both, if the actual sale consideration of such land and/or building is less than the stamp duty value, then the stamp duty value will be taken as full value of consideration,<br> i.e., as deemed selling price and capital gain will be computed accordingly.<br>
                                    <strong><em>Illustration</em></strong><br>
                                    Mr. Raja sold his bungalow for Rs. 80,00,000. The value adopted by the Stamp Valuation Authority of the bungalow for the purpose of payment of stamp duty is Rs. 84,00,000. In this situation, while computing taxable capital gain arising on transfer of bungalow, Rs. 84,00,000 will be taken as full value of consideration (i.e., sale value of the bungalow). Thus, actual selling price of Rs. 80,00,000 (being less than stamp duty value) will not be taken into account while computing taxable capital gain.<br>
                                    <strong><em>Illustration</em></strong><br>
                                    Mr. Karan sold his land for Rs. 25,20,000. The value adopted by the Stamp Valuation Authority of the bungalow for the purpose of payment of stamp duty is Rs. 20,00,000. In this situation, while computing taxable capital gain arising on transfer of land, Rs. 25,20,000 (being actual sale value) will be taken as full value of consideration. Thus, stamp duty value (being less than actual selling price) will not be taken into account while computing taxable capital gain.<br>

                                    As per the recent decision by ITAT in the case of ACIT Vs. Sh. Vineet Kumar Kapila (ITAT Delhi), ITAT held that booking of flat with the builder has to be treated as construction of flat by the assessee and hence period of three years would apply for construction of new house from the date of transfer of long term capital asset. Therefore, the Ld. CIT(A) has rightly allowed the exemption u/s. 54 of the Act, because in the present case also the flat booked with the builder by the assesse has to be considered as a case of construction of flat and the deduction claimed by the assessee u/s. 54 of the Act was rightly allowed,

                              <p><strong>Concept of set-off:</strong><br>
Specific provisions have been made in the Income-tax Act, 1961 for the set-off and carry forward of losses. In simple words, &ldquo;Set-off&rdquo; means adjustment of losses against the profits from another source/head of income in the same assessment year. If losses cannot be set-off in the same year due to inadequacy of eligible profits, then such losses are carried forward to the next assessment year for adjustment against the eligible profits of that year. The maximum period for which different losses can be carried forward for set-off has been provided in the Act.<br>
<strong>Intra head set off/Inter source adjustment [Section 70]</strong><br>
Under this section, the losses incurred by the Assessee in respect of one source shall be set-off against income from any other source under the same head of income, since the income under each head is to be computed by grouping together the net result of the activities of all the sources covered by that head. In simpler terms, loss from one source of income can be adjusted against income from another source, both the sources being under the same head.<br>
<em>Example 1:</em>&nbsp;Loss from one house property can be set off against the income from another house property.<br>
<em>Example 2</em><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Loss from one business, say textiles, can be set off against income from any other business, say printing, in the same year as both these sources of income fall under one head of income. Therefore, the loss in one business may be set-off against the profits from another business in the same year.<br>
<strong>Exemptions for the above:</strong><br>
<ol>
<li>Short-term capital loss is allowed to be set off against both short-term capital gain and long-term capital gain. However, long-term capital loss can be set-off only against long-term capital gain and not short-term capital gain.</li>
<li>A loss in speculation business can be set-off only against the profits of any other speculation business and not against any other business or professional income. However, losses from other business can be adjusted against profits from speculation business.</li>
<li>The losses incurred by an Assessee from the activity of owning and maintaining race horses cannot be set-off against the income from any other source other than the activity of owning and maintaining race horses.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Inter head adjustment [Section 71]</strong><br>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Loss under one head of income can be adjusted or set off against income under another head. However, the following points should be considered:<br>
<ol>
<li>Loss under head Capital Gains cannot be set-off with any other head of income.</li>
<li>Loss under the head Profits and gains from business or profession cannot be set off with income from salary</li>
<li>Speculation loss and loss from the activity of owning and maintaining race horses cannot be set off against income under any other head.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Loss from exempted source of income cannot be adjusted against taxable income:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
If income from a particular source is exempt from tax, then loss from such exempted source cannot be set off against any other income which is chargeable to tax.<br>
<strong>E.g.,</strong>&nbsp;Agricultural income is exempt from tax, if the taxpayer incurs loss from agricultural activity, then such loss cannot be adjusted against any other taxable income.<br>

Till the financial year 2016-17(AY 2017-18) there is no limit on the amount of house property loss set off with other heads of income but from financial year 2017-18 (AY 2018-19) that is from 01<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;of April 2017, set off for the house property loss with other heads of income is limited to Rs. 2 Lakhs.<br>
The loss if any in excess to 2 Lakhs can be carried forward and set off with the income from house property in the next 8 Assessment years (Immediate).<br>
One should be clear about the amendment; it is not limiting the housing loan interest u/s 24b for a let out property but is limiting the amount of loss that can be set off with other heads of income<br>
This amendment is not impacting those only having a single self occupied property because for self occupied property the housing loan interest that can be claimed as deduction under sec 24b is limited to Rs. 2 Lakhs and the loss of house property which actually arises due to housing loan interest will also be less than or equal to Rs. 2 lakhs.<br>
When we see the let out/rented out property the housing loan interest that can be claimed as deduction under sec 24b is unlimited and loss arising from the house property may be more than 2 lakhs. In this way the new amendment impacts the let out/ rented out property.<br>

<em><u>Case Law: TATA AIG GENERAL INSURANCE PVT LTD Vs DCIT ITAT (Mumbai)- ITA No.968 (MUM)2015.</u></em><br>
<strong><em>Assessment under section 143(1)</em></strong><br>
This is intimation from the CPC and is a computer generated statement. All the data available in the Income Tax Return is validated by CPC with reference to the data available in the records of the income tax department.<br>
<strong><em>Scope of assessment under section 143(1)</em></strong><br>
Intimation under section 143(1) is like primary verification of the return of income filed. At this stage of verification detailed examination of the return of income is not carried out. At this stage, the total income or loss is computed after making the adjustments (if any). Some of the adjustments made can be for the following matters:-<br>
 
<li>The arithmetical errors in the return of income filed; or</li>
<li>Any incorrect claims made in the return of income;</li>
<li>Any loss claimed will be disallowed, if return of the previous year for which set-off of loss is claimed was furnished after the due date specified for filing the return of income;</li>
<li>Any expenditure mentioned in the audit report will be disallowed if it is not taken into consideration for the computation of total income in the return filed;</li>
<li>Any deduction claimed u/s 10AA, 80IA to 80-IE will also be disallowed, if the return is furnished after the due date specified for filing the return of income; or</li>
<li>Any additional income appearing in Form 26AS which was not included in computing the total income in the return of income.</li>
 
However, no adjustment shall be made by CPC unless intimation is given to the assessee of such adjustment either in writing or in electronic mode. So, the assessee will get the intimation about the adjustment. If the assessee gives any response, such response shall be considered before making any adjustment, and if no response is received within 30 days from the issue of the intimation, adjustments shall be made by the department.<br></p>

Every taxpayer has to furnish the details of his income to the Income-tax Department. These details are to be furnished by filing up his return of income. Once the return of income is filed up by the taxpayer, the next step is the processing of the return of income by the Income Tax Department. The Income Tax Department examines the return of income for its correctness. The process of examining the return of income by the Income Tax department is called as &ldquo;<strong>Assessment</strong>&rdquo;. Assessment also includes&nbsp;<strong>re-assessment</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>best judgment assessment&nbsp;</strong>under section 144.<br>
Under the Income-tax Law, there are four major assessments given below:<br>
 
<li>Assessment under section 143(1), i.e., Summary assessment without calling the assessee.</li>
<li>Assessment under section 143(3), i.e., Scrutiny assessment.</li>
<li>Assessment under section 144, i.e., Best judgment assessment.</li>
<li>Assessment under section 147, i.e., Income escaping assessment.</li>

The assessee having filed in the return the details of taxes paid, but failed to provide income details, the Income Tax Department deems the return as defective.<br>
The assessee having claimed the tax deducted at source (TDS) as refund, failed to provide income details in the return. In such cases the return will be deemed to be defective.<br>
The assessee having liability to pay taxes fails to pay the taxes in full before filing the return.<br>
The Assessee who is required to maintain balance sheet and profit and loss statement as per the provisions of Income tax Act, 1961, but fails to provide such statements while preparing the income tax return.<br>
When there is a mismatch of name in the return filed with the name as per PAN card.<br>
In order to clear the defects in the original return filed i.e. in response to the notice sent by the department u/s 139(9), the assessee is required to file response within&nbsp;<strong>15 days</strong>&nbsp;of the receipt of intimation or within such other time as extended by the AO on a written request filed for the same.

How the scrutiny assessment can be made by the assessing officer (AO)?<br>
For making the scrutiny assessment the AO has to issue a notice to the assessee (i.e., the tax payer) u/s 148 and assessee should be given an opportunity of being heard. The time-limit for issuance this notice u/s 148 is a period of&nbsp;<u>4 years</u>&nbsp;from the end of the relevant assessment year. If the income escaped by the assessee is Rs. 1,00,000 or more and certain other conditions are satisfied, then notice can be issued upto&nbsp;<u>6 years</u>&nbsp;from the end of the relevant assessment year.<br>
In case the income which is escaped relates to any asset located outside India, notice can be issued upto&nbsp;<u>16 years</u>&nbsp;from the end of the relevant assessment year.<br>
Notice under section 148 can be issued by AO only after getting prior approval from the prescribed authority.<br>
The objective of carrying out assessment under section 147 is to bring under the tax net any income which has escaped assessment in original assessment under sections 143(1), 143(3), 144 &amp; 147 (as the case may be).<br>
In the following cases, it will be considered as income having escaped assessment:<br>
 
<li>Where no return of income has been furnished by the taxpayer, although his total income or the total income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable during the previous year exceeded the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income-tax.</li>
<li>Where a return of income has been furnished by the taxpayer but no assessment has been made and it is noticed by the Assessing Officer that the taxpayer has understated the income or has claimed excessive loss, deduction, allowance or relief in the return.</li>
<li>Where the taxpayer has failed to furnish a report in respect of any international transaction which he was required to do under section 92E.</li>
<li>Where an assessment has been made, but:
 
<li>income chargeable to tax has been under assessed; or</li>
<li>income has been assessed at low rate; or</li>
 
</li>
 
 
<li>income has been made the subject of excessive relief; or</li>
 
 
<li>excessive loss or depreciation allowance or any other allowance has been computed;</li>
 
 
<li>Where a person is found to have any asset (including financial interest in any entity) located outside India.</li>
<li>Where a return of income has not been furnished by the assessee and on the basis of information or document received from the prescribed income-tax authority under section 133C(2), it is noticed by the Assessing Officer that the income of the assessee exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to tax.</li>
<li>Where a return of income has been furnished by the assessee and on the basis of information or document received from the prescribed income-tax authority under section 133C(2), it is noticed by the Assessing Officer that the assessee has understated the income or has claimed excessive loss, deduction, allowance or relief in the return.</li>
